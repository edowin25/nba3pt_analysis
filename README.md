<!-- PROJECT CONTEXT -->
## Project Context
Over the years, we have seen the popularity of the 3 point shot in the game of basketball rise all around us. This whole hype first started out with Stephen Curry, dubbed as the greatest shooter of all times and the Golden State Warriors revolutionalise a new type of offense where it focuses on small ball and 3 pointers which deviates from scoring through the forwards and centers in the paint.

In the NBA, we see players of various positions, including centers, attempting a greater amount of 3 point shots and with some taking ridiculous long distance 3 pointers. Even in the neighbourhoods, we see players attempting to emulate curry in shooting 3s.

However, a thought comes to mind... What are the specific changes that the NBA has seen due to the 3 pointers and how efficient is the 3pointers to the game.
